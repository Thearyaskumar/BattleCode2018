# Code submission for team error: ';' expected
### How to test code
First, ssh into battle@aryask.tk. The password is BattleCode2018
In this window, type 'run'

The manager will be up at aryask.tk:6147/run.html
If you've made changes to your code, just open another window,
ssh into battle again, and call 'refresh'

When the replay has finished, use the second window and call 'push'
You can press 'stop manager' on the website, and once the window 
which is running the server shows you a prompt again, just close it.
